## Setup

There are two main ways of using this blog:
* Latest development build: Just clone this repository and you are good to go (aka you are using the `master` branch).
* Latest release: Download the latest release from the [release page](https://github.com/linkdotnet/Blog/releases).

The development builds can be either unstable or use preview version of packages or the .net SDK itself. So only use it if you are willing to help with testing or development.
If you just want to use the blog, use the latest release.

There are some settings you can tweak. The following chapter will guide you
through the possibilities.

-   [Configurations](Configuration.md)
-   [Docker](Docker.md)

### Updates
Going from one version to another can introduce major breaking changes. The [release page](https://github.com/linkdotnet/Blog/releases) or [`MIGRATION.md`](../../MIGRATION.md) will show the steps to migrate.
